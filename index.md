After six months of reflection and writing about the University of Cambridge Museums Nursery in Residence, we are excited to be able to share the findings of our collaborative, practitioner-led research project.
‘Stand aside for a while and leave room for learning, observe what children do, and then, if you have understood it well, perhaps teaching will be different from before.’ – Loris Malaguzzi

In October 2017, nine children from a Cambridge City Nursery spent five consecutive mornings ‘In Residence’ at the Fitzwilliam Museum and Cambridge University Botanic Garden. The residency formed the basis of a multi-disciplinary practitioner-led research project by a team of museum, garden and nursery practitioners. We hoped that the residency would give us the opportunity to ‘stand aside for a while and leave room for learning’, as Malaguzzi describes above. We hoped to develop a better understanding of what the museum and garden offers to young learners by working in partnership to create opportunities for them to explore our spaces and collections. We were also interested in sharing and developing good practice within each of our settings.
